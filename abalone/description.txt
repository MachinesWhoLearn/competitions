Abalone Age Prediction Challenge

THE THEME OF THIS COMPETITION IS "HAVE FUN". Contestants that do not have fun while building their predictors will not be considered.

Our last competition classifying Higgs Boson was too exciting, so this week we are predicting the number of rings (= Age - 1.5) of sea snails.

This is technically a multivariate classification problem, but we'll treat it as a regression problem. Our metric of goodness of fit will be root mean square error (RMSE).

trainData.csv is in the following format:

"Sex","Length","Diameter",...,"Rings"
Sex_1,Length_1,Diameter_1,...,Rings_1
Sex_2, Length_2,...,Rings_2 
...

To read the data into R, simply change to the correct working directory and call:

> trainData <- read.csv("trainData.csv")

In Python, working with Pandas:

import pandas as pd
train_data = pd.DataFrame.from_csv('trainData.csv')

An unlabeled test set will be released a few days before the competition deadline. Please submit your results in a file named lastname_firstname_abalone.dat in the following format:

(estimated prediction error)
y_hat1
y_hat2
....

For example, if I (Phil Snyder) think my prediction error on the test set will be 0.33, and the # of rings on the first 3 snails are 1, 2, 4, I will save the output:

0.33
1
2
4
....

in the file snyder_phil_abalone.dat

To do this in R, run these lines of code:

> head(predictions)
1  2  3  4  5 etc
1  1 -1  1 -1 etc
> write(as.character(predictions), file='lastname_firstname_abalone.dat', ncolumns=1)

And then open lastname_firstname_abalone.dat in your favorite text editor and add your predicted test set error to the first line.

For now, you may email your submissions to phil0 [at] uw [dot] edu.

In the interest of fairness, please do not train your model on any of the data points from the original dataset that are not in the training data provided here :-)
