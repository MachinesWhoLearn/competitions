Higgs Boson Classification Challenge

THE THEME OF THIS COMPETITION IS "TREES". Predictors that do not use trees as an essential structure in their predictive model will not be considered. (i.e., please don't train a convolutional neural net just yet).

It took scientists 40 years and billions of dollars to detect the Higgs Boson. We're going to do it with about 70% accuracy over two weeks. No domain knowledge is necessary to do relatively well in this challenge.

See the link to the original dataset below for everything you need to know about the data itself. There is a small aesthetic change to the dataset. The labels have been adjusted so that -1 is background and 1 is signal.

trainData.csv is in the following format:

"","V1","V2","V3",...,"V29"
"Id_1",V1_1,V2_1,V3_1,...,V29_1
"Id_2",V1_2, V2_2,...,V29_2 
...

This is a standard csv format that you'll see again and again.

To read the data into R, simply change to the correct working directory and call:

> trainData <- read.csv("trainData.csv")
> trainData$V1 <- factor(trainData$V1) # Since we're doing classification

In Python, working with Pandas:

import pandas as pd
train_data = pd.DataFrame.from_csv('trainData.csv')

See python_example.ipynb for some simple starter code.

An unlabeled test set will be released a few days before the competition deadline. Please submit your results in a file named lastname_firstname_higgs.dat in the following format:

(estimated prediction error)
y_hat1
y_hat2
....

For example, if I (Phil Snyder) think my prediction error on the test set will be 0.33, and the classes of the first 3 data points are 1, 1, -1, I will save the output:

0.33
1
1
-1
....

in the file snyder_phil_higgs.dat

To do this in R, run these lines of code:

> head(predictions)
1  2  3  4  5 etc
1  1 -1  1 -1 etc
> write(as.character(predictions), file='lastname_firstname_higgs.dat', ncolumns=1)

And then open lastname_firstname_higgs.dat in your favorite text editor and add your predicted test set error to the first line.

For now, you may email your submissions to phil0 [at] uw [dot] edu.

In the interest of fairness, please do not train your model on any of the data points from the original dataset that are not in the training data provided here :-)
