# Battle of the Nets

A performance comparison of LeNet, VGGNet, and The All Convolutional Net architectures on CIFAR-10 implemented using Keras.

Any parameters not explicitely specified in the papers you are free to set on your own. It's also possible that Keras doesn't have the functionality used in the paper. In that case approximate with a different function [or implement the missing function on your own and submit a pull request :-)]. Specific net comments below.

##LeNet
Generalize to work with RGB images.

## VGGNet
Use ConvNet Configuration A.

## All Convolutional Net
Replace the pooling layers using option (2). Use Model A as a base model.
